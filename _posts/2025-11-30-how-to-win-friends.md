# How to Win Friends and Influence People - Summary

## About This Book

Dale Carnegie's classic self-help book, first published in 1937, revolutionized the way people think about human relations. Based on years of research and practical application through his courses, this book provides timeless principles for improving interpersonal skills in both professional and personal contexts.

## Core Philosophy

The fundamental premise is simple yet profound: success in dealing with people depends on understanding human nature and respecting the basic desires that drive human behavior. Carnegie emphasizes that people crave appreciation, importance, and recognition more than almost anything else.

## Part One: Fundamental Techniques in Handling People

### Principle 1: Don't Criticize, Condemn, or Complain

**Key Insight**: Criticism is futile because it puts people on the defensive and makes them justify their actions rather than change.

**Examples**:
- "Two Gun" Crowley, a notorious criminal, didn't blame himself for his crimes, writing "Under my coat is a weary heart, but a kind one"
- Al Capone regarded himself as a public benefactor despite his criminal activities
- Lincoln learned from a near-duel experience to never criticize anyone again

**The Psychology**: People don't criticize themselves, so they certainly won't accept criticism from others. As B.F. Skinner proved, rewarding good behavior works better than punishing bad behavior.

**Application**: Instead of condemning others, try to understand why they act as they do. Remember: "Judge not, that ye be not judged."

### Principle 2: Give Honest and Sincere Appreciation

**Key Insight**: The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.

**Examples**:
- Charles Schwab earned over $1 million annually partly due to his ability to arouse enthusiasm through appreciation
- Andrew Carnegie's tombstone read: "Here lies one who knew how to get around him men who were cleverer than himself"
- Showing appreciation to a young blind boy (Stevie Wonder) for his remarkable hearing changed his life

**Important Distinction**: Appreciation differs from flattery. Appreciation is sincere and comes from the heart; flattery is insincere and selfish.

**Application**: Look for genuine qualities to appreciate in others and express that appreciation sincerely and specifically.

### Principle 3: Arouse in the Other Person an Eager Want

**Key Insight**: The only way to influence someone is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.

**Examples**:
- Henry Ford: "If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view"
- Andrew Carnegie used his nephews' desire for money to get them to write to their mother
- A father connected eating healthy food to his son's desire to beat up a neighborhood bully

**The Psychology**: Everyone is interested in what they want, not what you want. Success comes from seeing things from the other person's perspective.

**Application**: Before asking someone to do something, ask yourself: "How can I make this person want to do it?"

## Part Two: Six Ways to Make People Like You

### Principle 1: Become Genuinely Interested in Other People

**Key Insight**: You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in others than in two years by trying to get others interested in you.

**Examples**:
- A dog makes friends effortlessly by showing genuine joy at seeing you
- Theodore Roosevelt remembered the names of everyone he met, even servants
- A salesperson who showed interest in a client's stamp collection won a major account

**The Psychology**: Alfred Adler noted that those not interested in their fellow humans have the greatest difficulties in life.

**Application**: Show genuine curiosity about others' lives, interests, and achievements. Remember: people are primarily interested in themselves.

### Principle 2: Smile

**Key Insight**: A simple smile says "I like you. You make me happy. I am glad to see you."

**Examples**:
- William B. Steinhardt transformed his marriage by simply smiling at breakfast
- A veterinarian's waiting room changed from tense to pleasant when a baby smiled at a grumpy man
- Phone companies teach "phone power" – smiling while talking on the phone

**The Psychology**: Actions speak louder than words. Your smile is a messenger of your goodwill.

**Application**: Smile genuinely. As William James said, act as if you're already happy, and happiness will follow.

### Principle 3: Remember That a Person's Name is Sweet Music

**Key Insight**: A person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.

**Examples**:
- Jim Farley could call 50,000 people by their first names, helping put FDR in the White House
- Andrew Carnegie named a steel mill after J. Edgar Thomson to secure business
- Napoleon III would write down names and study them to remember people

**Application**: Make a conscious effort to remember names. Repeat them during conversation, associate them with the person's appearance, and use them frequently.

### Principle 4: Be a Good Listener and Encourage Others to Talk About Themselves

**Key Insight**: Exclusive attention to the person speaking is very flattering and rare.

**Examples**:
- A man became known as an "interesting conversationalist" despite saying almost nothing – he just listened to a botanist talk
- A telephone company representative solved a major complaint by listening for three hours
- Lincoln listened to an old friend for hours without asking for advice, just needing to talk through his problems

**The Psychology**: People are more interested in themselves and their problems than in you and your problems.

**Application**: Ask questions that others will enjoy answering. Let them talk about their achievements and interests.

### Principle 5: Talk in Terms of the Other Person's Interests

**Key Insight**: The royal road to a person's heart is to talk about things they treasure most.

**Examples**:
- Theodore Roosevelt studied topics his guests were interested in before they visited
- A Boy Scout leader secured funding by asking about a million-dollar check, appealing to the donor's pride
- A bread salesman won a contract by discussing the buyer's hobby: the Hotel Greeters organization

**Application**: Research what matters to people before meeting them. Find out their interests and speak to those interests.

### Principle 6: Make the Other Person Feel Important – and Do It Sincerely

**Key Insight**: The deepest urge in human nature is "the desire to be important."

**Examples**:
- A simple compliment to a postal clerk about his hair created a loyal relationship
- Treating a humble "Marie the Dishwasher" as important transformed her life
- Making an employee feel important as "Supervisor of Price Tag Posting" solved a performance problem

**The Golden Rule Application**: "Do unto others as you would have others do unto you." Everyone wants to feel important and appreciated.

**Application**: Look for genuine qualities that make others important. Express sincere appreciation for their contributions.

## Part Three: How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking

### Principle 1: Avoid Arguments

**Key Insight**: You can't win an argument. If you lose, you lose. If you win, you still lose because you've made the other person feel inferior.

**Examples**:
- Patrick J. O'Haire transformed his sales career by agreeing with customers instead of arguing
- A tax consultant resolved a dispute by appreciating the inspector rather than arguing
- Ben Franklin said: "If you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve a victory sometimes; but it will be an empty victory"

**Buddha's Wisdom**: "Hatred is never ended by hatred but by love."

**Application**: Welcome disagreement as an opportunity to learn. Control your temper and listen first. Look for areas of agreement.

### Principle 2: Show Respect for Others' Opinions – Never Say "You're Wrong"

**Key Insight**: Telling someone they're wrong only makes them defensive and determined to prove themselves right.

**Examples**:
- Galileo: "You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within himself"
- A Dodge dealer transformed customer relationships by saying "I may be wrong. Let's examine the facts"
- Ben Franklin stopped using words like "certainly" and instead said "I conceive" or "It appears to me"

**The Psychology**: When we're told we're wrong, our pride demands we remain consistent with our position.

**Application**: Begin with phrases like "I may be wrong. I frequently am. Let's examine the facts together."

### Principle 3: If You're Wrong, Admit It Quickly and Emphatically

**Key Insight**: Admitting your mistakes disarms criticism and often makes the other person magnanimous.

**Examples**:
- Carnegie admitted to a policeman he'd violated park rules before being accused, and the officer became friendly
- Robert E. Lee took full responsibility for Pickett's failed charge at Gettysburg
- A son reconciled with his father after the father admitted his mistakes with opium addiction

**The Psychology**: Self-criticism is much easier to accept than criticism from others. It takes courage and character.

**Application**: When you're wrong, admit it enthusiastically before the other person can say anything.

### Principle 4: Begin in a Friendly Way

**Key Insight**: A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.

**Examples**:
- John D. Rockefeller Jr. calmed striking workers by praising their peaceful methods and providing entertainment
- Lincoln: "A drop of honey that catches his heart... is the great high road to his reason"
- A tenant was convinced to stay by being treated with friendliness and respect rather than legal threats

**The Sun vs. Wind Fable**: Gentleness and friendliness are always stronger than fury and force.

**Application**: Start every interaction with warmth and friendliness. Smile, be pleasant, and show appreciation.

### Principle 5: Get the Other Person Saying "Yes, Yes" Immediately

**Key Insight**: Getting someone to say "yes" at the outset sets their psychological process moving in the affirmative direction.

**Examples**:
- A bank teller secured a difficult customer by getting him to agree on small points first
- A salesperson won a large order by asking questions that led to "yes" responses about standards
- Socrates's method was based on asking questions that opponents would agree with

**The Psychology**: When someone says "no," their entire organism sets itself against acceptance. Get agreement early.

**Application**: Structure your conversation to secure small agreements before presenting your main request.

### Principle 6: Let the Other Person Do Most of the Talking

**Key Insight**: People know more about their business and problems than you do. Let them tell you.

**Examples**:
- A salesperson won a major contract despite losing his voice – the client talked himself into the sale
- A daughter's behavior improved when her mother stopped lecturing and started listening
- Charles Cubellis won a job by letting the employer talk about his achievements

**La Rochefoucauld's Advice**: "If you want friends, let your friends excel you."

**Application**: Ask questions and let others talk about themselves. Be genuinely interested in what they say.

### Principle 7: Let the Other Person Feel the Idea Is Theirs

**Key Insight**: People have more faith in ideas they discover themselves than ideas handed to them.

**Examples**:
- A textile salesman let buyers finish his sketches according to their ideas, and all were purchased
- Colonel House planted ideas in President Wilson's mind and let Wilson believe they were his own
- A father let his family decide on vacation destination by asking questions rather than dictating

**Ralph Waldo Emerson**: "In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts."

**Application**: Make suggestions and ask questions that lead people to your conclusion on their own.

### Principle 8: Try Honestly to See Things from the Other Person's Point of View

**Key Insight**: Success in dealing with people depends on a sympathetic grasp of the other person's viewpoint.

**Examples**:
- Carnegie stopped fires in the park by understanding why boys built them and working with them
- A woman resolved a late payment issue by seeing things from the bill collector's perspective
- Dean Donham: "I would rather walk the sidewalk for two hours before an interview than step into that office without understanding the other person's perspective"

**The Psychology**: If you were the other person, you would feel exactly as they do.

**Application**: Before every important interaction, think deeply about what the other person wants and why.

### Principle 9: Be Sympathetic with the Other Person's Ideas and Desires

**Key Insight**: Three-fourths of the people you meet are hungering for sympathy. Give it to them.

**Examples**:
- Carnegie turned a hostile letter writer into a friend by expressing sympathy for her viewpoint
- President Taft softened angry mothers by expressing sympathy for their disappointment
- A piano teacher successfully asked a student to cut her long nails by first sympathizing with how beautiful they were

**Magic Phrase**: "I don't blame you one iota for feeling as you do. If I were you, I would undoubtedly feel just as you do."

**Application**: Show genuine empathy and understanding for others' feelings, even when you disagree.

### Principle 10: Appeal to Nobler Motives

**Key Insight**: All people like to think of themselves as idealistic and having good motives.

**Examples**:
- J.P. Morgan: "A person usually has two reasons for doing a thing: one that sounds good and a real one"
- A landlord kept a tenant by appealing to his honor rather than threatening legal action
- Lord Northcliffe stopped photo publication by saying "My mother doesn't like it" rather than expressing his own preference

**The Psychology**: People want to think well of themselves. Appeal to their better nature.

**Application**: Assume and express that others are honorable and trustworthy. Appeal to their integrity.

### Principle 11: Dramatize Your Ideas

**Key Insight**: The truth has to be made vivid, interesting, and dramatic to capture attention.

**Examples**:
- A newspaper published a book showing one day's content to prove they had plenty of news
- A rat poison company displayed live rats in windows, increasing sales fivefold
- A market researcher dumped 32 jars of competing cold cream on an executive's desk to dramatize his data

**Modern Application**: Television commercials use dramatic demonstrations constantly because they work.

**Application**: Use showmanship, visual aids, and demonstrations to make your point memorable.

### Principle 12: Throw Down a Challenge

**Key Insight**: The desire to excel and win is a powerful motivator.

**Examples**:
- Charles Schwab motivated workers by writing production numbers on the floor, creating friendly competition
- Theodore Roosevelt stayed in politics when challenged: "Is the hero of San Juan Hill a coward?"
- Al Smith convinced a reluctant Lewis Lawes to become warden of Sing Sing by saying it would take "a big person"

**Frederic Herzberg's Research**: The work itself, when exciting and interesting, is the most motivating factor.

**Application**: Challenge people's pride and desire to excel. Make the task exciting and competitive.

## Part Four: Be a Leader – How to Change People Without Giving Offense

### Principle 1: Begin with Praise and Honest Appreciation

**Key Insight**: It's easier to listen to unpleasant things after hearing praise of good points.

**Examples**:
- McKinley softened rejection of a speech by praising it first, then suggesting modifications
- Lincoln's letter to General Hooker began with praise before discussing concerns
- A bank employee became productive after being praised for her accuracy with customers

**The Barber Analogy**: A barber lathers a man before shaving him.

**Application**: Always start difficult conversations with sincere appreciation and praise.

### Principle 2: Call Attention to Mistakes Indirectly

**Key Insight**: Indirect criticism is less offensive and more effective than direct criticism.

**Examples**:
- Charles Schwab handed cigars to men smoking under a "No Smoking" sign and asked them to smoke outside
- A mayor removed his office door to symbolically ensure accessibility rather than scolding staff
- Change "but" to "and" when giving feedback: "You did well, AND if you continue this way..."

**Application**: Imply mistakes rather than stating them bluntly. Show the positive path forward.

### Principle 3: Talk About Your Own Mistakes First

**Key Insight**: Admitting your own failures makes criticism of others much easier to accept.

**Examples**:
- Carnegie would tell his niece about his own mistakes at her age before discussing hers
- An engineer shared his spelling struggles with his secretary before pointing out her errors
- Prince von Bülow saved himself with Kaiser Wilhelm by praising the Kaiser's strengths while admitting his own weaknesses

**The Psychology**: It's easier to listen to criticism when the critic admits they're not perfect either.

**Application**: Before criticizing, tell about similar mistakes you've made.

### Principle 4: Ask Questions Instead of Giving Orders

**Key Insight**: People are more likely to accept and take ownership of solutions they help create.

**Examples**:
- Owen D. Young never gave direct orders but said "You might consider this" or "Do you think that would work?"
- A manufacturing manager asked his team how to handle an order rather than demanding they work faster
- A professor asked "Do you think you need a haircut?" rather than ordering military haircuts

**The Psychology**: Questions stimulate creativity and give people a feeling of control.

**Application**: Ask questions that let people reach the desired conclusion themselves.

### Principle 5: Let the Other Person Save Face

**Key Insight**: Hurting someone's dignity is a crime that can destroy working relationships.

**Examples**:
- General Electric made Steinmetz a "Consulting Engineer" rather than demoting him publicly
- A manager handled a seasonal employee's termination by praising their work and expressing confidence
- A boss supported an employee who made a major error rather than berating her publicly

**Antoine de Saint-Exupéry**: "I have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes."

**Application**: Always preserve others' dignity and self-respect, even when making changes.

### Principle 6: Praise Every Improvement

**Key Insight**: Abilities wither under criticism but blossom under encouragement.

**Examples**:
- Praising children for small improvements transformed family dynamics
- A printer's attitude changed completely when someone genuinely appreciated his excellent work
- Enrico Caruso became a great singer partly due to his mother's praise and encouragement

**B.F. Skinner's Teaching**: Reinforcing good behavior is more effective than punishing bad behavior.

**Application**: Be specific in your praise. Point out exactly what was good and why it matters.

### Principle 7: Give People a Fine Reputation to Live Up To

**Key Insight**: Assume people have virtues you want them to develop, and they'll make extraordinary efforts not to disappoint you.

**Examples**:
- Telling "Marie the Dishwasher" she had "treasures within her" transformed her life
- A mechanic improved performance when told "you are a fine mechanic"
- A teacher calling Tommy a "natural leader" changed his behavior completely

**Shakespeare**: "Assume a virtue, if you have it not."

**Application**: Express confidence in people's abilities to excel. Give them a reputation worth living up to.

### Principle 8: Make Faults Seem Easy to Correct

**Key Insight**: Encouragement makes improvement seem achievable rather than overwhelming.

**Examples**:
- A dance teacher said "fundamentals are right" rather than "everything is wrong," motivating the student
- Lowell Thomas convinced Carnegie that bridge was "right up your alley," giving him confidence
- A father helped his son master multiplication by making it a game and celebrating small improvements

**William James**: "Compared with what we ought to be, we are only half awake."

**Application**: Emphasize strengths while minimizing weaknesses. Make improvement seem natural and easy.

### Principle 9: Make People Happy to Do What You Suggest

**Key Insight**: Frame requests in terms of the benefits to the other person.

**Examples**:
- Colonel House made Bryan feel too important for a job rather than too small
- Napoleon created the Legion of Honor, giving "toys" to motivate soldiers
- A father got his son excited about kindergarten by focusing on the fun activities

**Six Guidelines for Change**:
1. Be sincere
2. Know exactly what you want
3. Be empathetic
4. Consider their benefits
5. Match benefits to their wants
6. Show how they'll personally benefit

**Application**: Never just command. Always explain how complying will benefit them personally.
